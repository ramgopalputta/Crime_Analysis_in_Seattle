# CRIME ANALYSIS IN SEATTLE

Using ArcGIS Pro, the project analyzed and visualized burglaries and assaults in Seattle's North and South precincts. The investigation identified high-crime hotspots using kernel density surfaces with contours and predicted future crime locations by the Risk Terrain Model. Additionally, the Location Quotient analysis was implemented.


# ASSAULTS IN SOUTH SEATTLE

This report is intended to visualize the Assaults that occurred in South Seattle, in the year 2018. The report also highlights
the hotspots of crime and predicts the locations of future Assaults. A total of 787 Assault calls were reported in that year. 
Thisreport illustrates the concentration of Assaults with respect to beats,splitting the number of Assaults by time intervals 
in a day, locating the hot spots of crime along with Centro graphic statistics, visualizing the crime hotspots using kernel 
density surfaces with contours and predicting the location of crime by Risk Terrain Model.

CONCLUSION:

In the year 2018, a greater number of Assaults were recorded between 12pm and 6pm. MOUNT BAKER is the 
neighborhood with the highest number of Assaults. GEORGETOWN, MID-BEACON HILL and SEWARD PARK neighborhoods 
are considered relatively safe. COLUMBIA CITY neighborhood is the mean center for all the crime locations. MOUNT 
BAKER, BEACON HILL, northern regions of INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT, DUNLAP and RAINIER BEACH neighborhoods are 
considered as crime hotspots with 99% confidence. Hence, the police could be instructed to pay special attention in these 
areas. COLUMBIA CITY is a neighborhood that has all the risk factors for assaults (Bars, Marijuana, Narcotic retail stores
and Parks) and the future crime can be predicted at these locations.
