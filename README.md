# Crime_Analysis_in_Seattle

Using ArcGIS Pro, the project analyzed and visualized burglaries and assaults in Seattle's North and South precincts. The investigation identified high-crime hotspots using kernel density surfaces with contours and predicted future crime locations by the Risk Terrain Model. Additionally, the Location Quotient analysis was implemented.
